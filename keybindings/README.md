# Karabiner-Elements

Remap the `F6` key to `Ctrl` + `c` combination - to quickly terminate a running process in the terminal for the *Dvorak* keyboard layout.

1. Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
2. Copy the `yboris.json` file into:
    > ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/yboris.json
3. Go to _Preferences_ -> _Complex Modifications_ inside _Karabiner_
4. Press `Add rule` and then `Enable` next to the "F6 breaks terminal process"

## Note:

This is meant for *Dvorak* keyboard layout, since the `i` key maps to the location `c` in _Dvorak_. You can just change `i` to `c` inside the _JSON_ for a regular QWERTY keyboard.
